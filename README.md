# Humane Technology Framework

A collection of tools, guidelines, and resources for building technology that respects human well-being, autonomy, and dignity.

## Vision

The Humane Technology Framework aims to provide developers, designers, and organizations with practical tools to create technology that:

- Respects user attention and time
- Enhances human capabilities without exploiting vulnerabilities
- Promotes user agency and control
- Fosters healthy relationships with technology
- Minimizes harmful impacts of technology

## Contents

- **[Principles](./docs/principles.md)**: Core values guiding humane technology development
- **[Assessment Tools](./docs/assessment-tools.md)**: Methods to evaluate the humaneness of technologies
- **[Design Patterns](./docs/design-patterns.md)**: Reusable solutions to common design challenges
- **[Implementation Examples](./examples/)**: Code samples and case studies
- **[Resources](./docs/resources.md)**: Books, articles, and research on humane technology

## Getting Started

Explore our documentation to learn about integrating humane design principles into your technology projects:

1. Read through our [principles](./docs/principles.md)
2. Use our [assessment checklist](./docs/assessment-tools.md) to evaluate existing products
3. Browse [design patterns](./docs/design-patterns.md) for specific interfaces and interactions
4. Check out [implementation examples](./examples/) for practical applications

## Contributing
