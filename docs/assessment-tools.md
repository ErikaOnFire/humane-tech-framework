## Supplement: Assessing Humane Tech Promises and Anti-Patterns
*Inspired by [buildinghumanetech.com](https://www.buildinghumanetech.com/)*

### Promises Assessment
For each, rate your product (1-4):
- **Cared for:** Does the product put user needs at the center?
- **Present:** Does it help users feel present in body and mind?
- **Fulfilled:** Do users feel satisfied with their experience and outcomes?
- **Connected:** Does it foster connection to self, others, or nature?

### Anti-Patterns Assessment
For each, rate your product (1-4, where 1 = major problem, 4 = not present):
- **Erodes Well-Being:** Does the product exploit attention or need for acceptance?
- **Divides Society:** Does it spread misinformation, polarize, or prioritize virality over truth?
- **Exploits Privacy:** Does it threaten data sanctity or enable surveillance?

## Attention Respect Assessment

Evaluate how a technology respects user attention:

| Criteria | High Score (5) | Medium Score (3) | Low Score (1) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Notifications | Used sparingly, only for true urgency or user value | Somewhat frequent but can be customized | Frequent, designed to pull users back |
| Stopping Cues | Clear indicators when tasks are complete | Some natural breaking points | Endless scrolling/autoplay with no natural exit points |
| Focus Protection | Features that help users maintain focus | Some interruptions but manageable | Constant interruptions and distractions |
| Cognitive Load | Interface reduces cognitive burden | Moderate complexity | Overwhelming options, information overload |

## Agency & Control Assessment

Evaluate how a technology supports user agency and control:

| Criteria | High Score (5) | Medium Score (3) | Low Score (1) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Meaningful Choices | Clear options with transparent consequences | Some options with partial transparency | Limited or illusory choices |
| Defaults | Set to most supportive of wellbeing | Neutral defaults | Defaults maximize engagement over wellbeing |
| Data Control | Users can access, control, and delete their data easily | Partial access and control | Difficult to access or control data |
| Customization | High degree of customization for diverse needs | Some customization options | One-size-fits-all approach |

## Relationship Impact Assessment

Evaluate how a technology affects relationships:

| Criteria | High Score (5) | Medium Score (3) | Low Score (1) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Human Connection | Fosters meaningful human interaction | Some support for authentic connection | Replaces or undermines human connection |
| Social Comparison | Avoids featuring metrics that encourage unhealthy comparison | Some potentially comparative elements | Heavy emphasis on metrics, likes, followers |
| Community Health | Features designed to encourage healthy community | Basic moderation tools | Few protections against toxic interaction |
| Boundary Respect | Clear boundaries between tech use and other life aspects | Some boundary-setting features | Designed to blur boundaries between tech and life |

## Transparency Assessment

Evaluate how transparent a technology is:

| Criteria | High Score (5) | Medium Score (3) | Low Score (1) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Algorithm Explanation | Clear explanations of how algorithms work | Some explanation but limited | Black box with no transparency |
| Data Use | Clear communication about what data is used and why | Partial disclosure | Opaque data collection and use |
| Business Model | Transparent about how the business makes money | Some clarity on business model | Hidden monetization strategies |
| Limitations | Honest about system capabilities and limitations | Some acknowledgment of limitations | Oversells capabilities |

## Wellbeing Impact Assessment

Consider the various dimensions of wellbeing a technology might affect:

- **Cognitive wellbeing**: Attention, focus, learning, cognitive load
- **Emotional wellbeing**: Stress, anxiety, joy, satisfaction
- **Social wellbeing**: Connection quality, relationship impacts, community
- **Physical wellbeing**: Movement, sleep, physical activity
- **Existential wellbeing**: Purpose, meaning, autonomy, identity

For each dimension, assess:
1. Potential positive impacts
2. Potential negative impacts
3. Mitigations for negative impacts
4. Opportunities to enhance positive impacts

## Using These Tools

1. **Score existing products** to identify areas for improvement
2. **Compare similar technologies** to make informed choices
3. **Guide development decisions** when creating new features
4. **Create improvement roadmaps** based on assessment findings

These tools are meant to be adapted to specific contexts and use cases. Not all criteria will apply to every technology.
