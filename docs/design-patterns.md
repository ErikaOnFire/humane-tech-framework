# Humane Design Patterns

> **Note:** All design patterns in this framework should support the Promises of Humane Technology (Cared for, Present, Fulfilled, Connected) and avoid the anti-patterns (Erodes Well-Being, Divides Society, Exploits Privacy), as described at [buildinghumanetech.com](https://www.buildinghumanetech.com/).

This document provides reusable design patterns that implement humane technology principles. Each pattern addresses common design challenges while prioritizing user wellbeing and agency.

## Attention Management Patterns

### Batched Notifications
**Problem:** Constant notifications interrupt user focus and create anxiety.
**Solution:** Group non-urgent notifications and deliver them at scheduled intervals.
**Implementation:**
- Allow users to set notification delivery schedules
- Categorize notifications by urgency
- Provide clear differentiation between urgent and non-urgent
- Include options to customize batching preferences

### Natural Stopping Points
**Problem:** Endless feeds create compulsive checking and scrolling behavior.
**Solution:** Design clear "stopping points" that provide natural breaks in content consumption.
**Implementation:**
- Create visual indicators of completion
- Add friction after meaningful content chunks
- Provide summary screens after a session
- Avoid infinite scrolling for certain content types

### Focus Modes
**Problem:** Multiple attention-grabbing elements make it difficult to focus.
**Solution:** Create dedicated modes that minimize distractions.
**Implementation:**
- Develop "do not disturb" modes with clear visual indicators
- Simplify interfaces during focused work
- Temporarily hide non-essential features
- Provide session summaries after focus time

## Agency & Control Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure of Options
**Problem:** Too many options at once can overwhelm users and lead to decision paralysis.
**Solution:** Present options progressively, from simple to advanced.
**Implementation:**
- Start with core functionality and most common options
- Provide clear paths to advanced features
- Remember user preferences for complexity level
- Design clear information architecture for settings

### Informed Defaults
**Problem:** Default settings often optimize for business goals rather than user wellbeing.
**Solution:** Set defaults that prioritize user wellbeing while clearly explaining options.
**Implementation:**
- Research which defaults best support user wellbeing
- Provide clear explanations during onboarding
- Make changing settings straightforward
- Avoid dark patterns in preference controls

### Data Controls Dashboard
**Problem:** Users lack visibility and control over their data.
**Solution:** Create a centralized dashboard for data visibility and control.
**Implementation:**
- Show what data is collected and why
- Provide granular permissions controls
- Include data export and deletion options
- Use clear, non-technical language

## Relationship Enhancement Patterns

### Quality Over Quantity Metrics
**Problem:** Numerical metrics (likes, followers) encourage social comparison.
**Solution:** Design metrics focused on quality of interaction rather than quantity.
**Implementation:**
- Highlight meaningful exchanges over volume
- Create alternative feedback mechanisms beyond counting
- Consider making certain metrics private
- Design for depth of engagement

### Common Ground Features
**Problem:** Many platforms amplify division and conflict.
**Solution:** Design features that highlight shared interests and perspectives.
**Implementation:**
- Create discovery mechanisms that find common ground
- Highlight shared interests before differences
- Design interaction flows that encourage understanding
- Provide context for potentially divisive content

### Healthy Boundary Tools
**Problem:** Technology often blurs boundaries between work, personal life, and leisure.
**Solution:** Create explicit tools for boundary setting and maintenance.
**Implementation:**
- Develop schedule-based access controls
- Create separate modes for different contexts
- Provide usage insights that respect contexts
- Design transition moments between contexts

## Transparency Patterns

### Algorithmic Transparency Cards
**Problem:** Users don't understand how algorithms affect what they see.
**Solution:** Create simple explanations of algorithmic decisions.
**Implementation:**
- Show key factors influencing content selection
- Provide plain language explanations of algorithms
- Include options to adjust algorithmic parameters
- Make transparency cards accessible but not intrusive

### Honest Loading
**Problem:** Artificial delays and progress indicators can be manipulative.
**Solution:** Use honest loading patterns that accurately represent system status.
**Implementation:**
- Show real progress rather than artificial animations
- Provide useful information during necessary waits
- Be honest about processing requirements
- Avoid manipulating perceptions of time
